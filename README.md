# Full-Stack
Full Stack is a personal productivity and experimentation dashboard built with a React + TypeScript frontend, a Django REST API backend, and a PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker. It lets you create and manage projects, tasks, tags, and notes while exploring modern React patterns (routing, forms, global state, custom hooks) against a real API.
